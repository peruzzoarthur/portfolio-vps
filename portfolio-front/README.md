# Arthur's Portfolio

Hello ðŸ‘‹  
My name is Arthur, and I'm a former Environmental Engineer with an emphasis on data analysis and GIS technologies, currently transitioning into the field of software development.

## About Me

I began my journey in software development approximately two years ago. Since then, I've been diligently building the skills needed to become a proficient fullstack web developer.

### Technologies I Use

- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React.js, @tanstack-router, @tanstack-query, Shadcn, Acerternity
- **Backend:** Nest.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Scripting:** Python (for data processing and GIS data analysis)

### Current Focus

Recently, I've been diving into Python, applying scripts for processing and analyzing Geographic Information System (GIS) data. My goal is to build a fullstack application that enables comprehensive data analysis, graphical plotting, and mapping.

## Portfolio Project

This project is the first version of my portfolio. It currently features only a front-end, built with React, @tanstack-router, and styled using Shadcn and Acerternity for the UI components.
